-- Negative numbers throw and error and shows the number(s) that triggered the error
-- Numbers greater than 1000 are ignored while adding
-- Supports custom delimiters.

Next ```npm i ``` to install dependencies.

Then, ```npm run simple-test``` should get you started.

You can configure and add more custom test cases in ```start.js``` for more results.
